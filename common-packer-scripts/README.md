Adding a user to TRADR  
[1] create add-user-foo.sh  
[2] add user to install-tradr-shell.sh  
[3] add a line to tradr7-packer.json  

Scripts used to build various packer machines
These are for Centos7
For Slackware, just copy them into the blackrain14 folder and use as required - this i snot DRY.
